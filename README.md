This is a simple, clean website built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Itâ€™s based on a Photoshop mockup called **[Hilltop - PSD Template for Creative Professionals]** â€” purchased from [Envato/ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/item/hilltop-psd-template-for-creative-professionals/19520245). The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes a home page, about page, portfolio page and contact page with a working contact form.

_This project is free and open-source, and focused on helping new frontend developers practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript with real-world examples._
